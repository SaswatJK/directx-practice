    D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD, //Type upload is the best for CPU read once and GPU write once Data. This type has CPU access optimized for uploading to the GPU, which is why it has a CPU virtual address, not just a GPU one. Resouurce on this Heap must be created with GENERIC_READ
    D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_UNKNOWN, //I used WRITE_COMBINE enum but it gave me error, so I have to use PROPERTY_UNKOWN. The write comobine ignores the cache and writes to a buffer, it's better for streaming data to another device like the GPU, but very inefficient if we wanna read for some reason from the same buffer this is pointing to.
    D3D12_MEMORY_POOL_UNKNOWN, //I used MEMORY_POOL_L0 but it gave me error, so I have to use POOL_UNKOWN. L0 means the system memory (RAM), while L1 is the videocard memory (VRAM). If integrated graphics exists, this will be slower for the GPU but the CPU will be faster than the GPU. However it does still support APUs and Integrated Graphics, while if we use L1, it's only available for systems with their own graphics cards. It cannot be accessed by the CPU at all, so it's only GPU accessed.
    //I think I read somehwere that the reason I got error was due to redundancy? I will check later
